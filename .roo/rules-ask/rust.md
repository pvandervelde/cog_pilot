## rust

**rust-documentation:** For public items documentation comments are always added. For private items documentation
comments are added when the item is complex or not self-explanatory. Use `///` for simple
documentation comments and `//!` for module-level documentation. Use `#[doc = "..."]` for
complex documentation that needs special formatting. Add examples to documentation comments
when possible, especially for public APIs.
