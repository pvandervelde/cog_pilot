## Key Principles

### Security First

All system components prioritize security over functionality. No feature is implemented without appropriate security controls.

### Least Privilege

Components and operations execute with the minimum privileges required for their function.

### Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security controls protect against various attack vectors.

### Fail Secure

System failures default to secure states, denying access rather than allowing potentially dangerous operations.

### Transparency

All security decisions and actions are logged and auditable.

### Immutable Infrastructure

Core system components are immutable and cannot be modified during runtime.
