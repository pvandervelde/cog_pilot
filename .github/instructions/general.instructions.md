# Copilot Instructions (Repository) - General

## general

**general-focus:** Focus on the task at hand. Avoid distractions and stay on topic.
If you need to switch tasks, make sure to finish the current task first.

**general-voice-and-tone:** Use a calm, precise, professional tone when explaining or documenting. Avoid overly casual
phrasing. Keep comments and responses focused, technical, and respectful.


## tooling

**tool-container-usage:** Use Docker/Podman for consistent development environments and deployment. Prefer official
base images and use multi-stage builds for optimization. Use .dockerignore to optimize
build context and reduce image size. Pin base image versions for reproducibility. Use
appropriate user permissions and don't run as root. Include health checks in production containers.

**tool-infrastructure-as-code:** Use infrastructure as code tools (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, Bicep) instead of manual
cloud console configuration. Version control all infrastructure definitions. Use modules/templates
for reusable components. Plan and review infrastructure changes before applying. Use separate
state files for different environments. Document infrastructure dependencies and deployment procedures.

**tool-package-managers:** Use appropriate package managers for each language: npm/pnpm/yarn for Node.js, pip/poetry/pipenv
for Python, cargo for Rust, dotnet for .NET, composer for PHP. Pin exact versions in lock files
for reproducible builds. Separate production and development dependencies. Use private registries
when needed. Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities. Keep dependencies updated
but test thoroughly before upgrading.


## scm

**scm-branch-naming:** The branch name should be a brief summary of the changes being made. Branch
names should be in lowercase and use hyphens to separate words. For example, `fix-bug-in-login-page`
or `feature-add-new-user`.

**scm-commit-message:** For commit messages the
type should be one of the following: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`,
`style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`. The scope should be the name of the module or component being changed. The subject should
be a short description of the change. The `work_item_ref` is one of the following issue references:
`references` or `related to` followed by the issue number.
Finally those parts make the following format for commit messages:

```text
type(scope): subject

description

 references <work_item_ref>
```

**scm-git-pull-request-title:** The pull request title should follow the conventional commit format.
`<type>(<scope>): <subject>` where `type` is one of the following: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`,
`style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`.

**scm-hygiene:** Commit changes frequently and in small increments. Follow the `scm-commit-message` format for commit messages. Use
`git fetch --prune` and `git pull` to update your local branch before pushing changes.

**scm-security:** Never commit secrets, API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data to version control. Use
.gitignore for build artifacts, temporary files, and OS-specific files. Sign commits for
sensitive repositories using GPG keys. Use branch protection rules to enforce review
requirements and status checks. Rotate any accidentally committed secrets immediately.
Use git hooks to prevent sensitive data commits when possible.


## workflow-guidelines

**wf-api-design:** Design APIs following REST principles, GraphQL best practices, or appropriate RPC patterns.
Version APIs appropriately using URL versioning, header versioning, or content negotiation.
Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger, GraphQL schema, or equivalent documentation tools.
Consider backward compatibility and implement graceful deprecation strategies. Use consistent
naming conventions, error handling patterns, and response formats across all endpoints.

**wf-code-style:** All code should be easy to understand and maintain. Use clear and descriptive
names for variables, functions, and classes. Always follow the coding standards and best practices
for the programming language being used.

**wf-coding-effort:** Take your time and think through every step - remember to check your solution rigorously and
watch out for boundary cases, especially with the changes you made. Your solution must be perfect.
If not, continue working on it. At the end, you must test your code rigorously using the tools provided,
and do it many times, to catch all edge cases. If it is not robust, iterate more and make it perfect.
Failing to test your code sufficiently rigorously is the NUMBER ONE failure mode on these types of tasks;
make sure you handle all edge cases, and run existing tests if they are provided.

**wf-database-changes:** Handle database schema changes with proper migration scripts that can be applied and rolled back safely.
Test migrations on realistic data volumes and scenarios. Plan rollback strategies for all database changes.
Use database versioning tools appropriate for your stack (Liquibase, Flyway, Django migrations, etc.).
Never modify existing migrations after they've been applied to production. Consider data migration impact
on application downtime and plan accordingly.

**wf-documentation:** The coding task is not complete without documentation. All code should be
well-documented. Use comments to explain the purpose of complex code and to provide context for
future developers. Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules. The documentation
should be clear and concise.

**wf-documentation-standards:** Follow the documentation standards and best practices for the
programming language being used.

**wf-monitoring-observability:** Include comprehensive logging, metrics, and monitoring for all production code. Use structured
logging with appropriate log levels and correlation IDs. Implement health checks and readiness
probes for services. Set up alerting for critical metrics and error rates. Plan for debugging
and troubleshooting in production environments. Use distributed tracing for complex systems.
Monitor performance, availability, and business metrics.

**wf-test-methods:** Employ different test approaches to get good coverage of both happy path
and error handling. Consider approaches like unit tests, property based testing, fuzz testing,
integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests. Use the appropriate testing
frameworks and tools for the programming language being used.

**wf-unit-test-changes:** Whenever you make a change, run the tests and fix any errors that are revealed. Fix one error at
a time and provide an explanation of why you think the change you made fixes the error

**wf-unit-test-check:** When you think you've solved the presented problem, run all available tests. Fix any issues that
you find.

**wf-unit-test-coverage:** All business logic should be covered by unit tests. We're aiming to cover
all input and output paths of the code. This includes edge cases and error handling. Use coverage
tools to measure the test coverage and use mutation testing to ensure that the tests are
effective.

**wf-unit-test-create-new:** Whenever you create a new test, run it to verify that it passes. If it doesn't pass, revise
either the test (or the code it tests) until the test passes.


## coding

**coding-comments:** Use comments to explain the purpose and reasoning behind non-obvious code. Focus on *why* the code is written
this way â€” for example, domain-specific constraints, algorithmic trade-offs, or error handling strategy.
Avoid commenting obvious control flow or syntax.

**coding-design-architecture:** Design modular, maintainable system components using appropriate technologies and frameworks. Ensure that integration
points are clearly defined and documented.

**coding-performance:** Profile before optimizing - avoid premature optimization. Use appropriate data structures and
algorithms for the problem at hand. Consider time and space complexity in algorithm selection.
Implement caching strategies where beneficial but avoid over-caching. Use lazy loading and
pagination for large datasets. Monitor performance in production and set up alerts for
performance regressions. Measure and optimize critical path operations.

**coding-review-before-commit:** Before committing code, review it for correctness, style, and test coverage. Ensure that **all** rules are followed,
that the code is as simple as it could be, and that the code is ready for production use. Now is the time to refactor
or simplify the code if needed.

**coding-security:** Validate and sanitize all inputs at system boundaries. Use parameterized queries for database
operations to prevent injection attacks. Implement proper authentication and authorization
mechanisms. Store secrets in secure secret management systems, never in code. Use HTTPS for
all network communications. Follow OWASP guidelines for web application security. Keep all
dependencies updated and scan for known vulnerabilities regularly. Implement proper session
management and CSRF protection.

**coding-style:** Follow the style guides for the language. Use the appropriate formatters to format your code. This will
help ensure that the code is consistent and easy to read.

**coding-test-execution:** Always assume tests should be executed. If tests cannot be run, clearly state this and provide expected output or
status. Use appropriate test runners for the language and framework being used.

**coding-test-granularity:** Each test should verify one behavior or input class. Use descriptive names that explain what is being tested.
Prefer many small, specific tests over a few broad ones.

**coding-tests-always:** After implementing any logic, immediately write unit tests that verify its correctness.
Include realistic inputs, edge cases, and error conditions. Use the naming convention rules for test files.

**coding-whitespace:** Always leave a whitespace between a line of code and a comment. This improves readability and helps to distinguish
between code and comments.
